title: Week of Feb 11 - Reads, Beats, and Eats
---
<p class="message">
Welcome to the first edition of, “Reads, Beats, and Eats!” I have wanted to get into the blogging space for quite some time, but I was never really sure where to start. I figured I could get the hang of it by publishing my favorite articles, songs, and food/recipes from the week. I hope to bring a variety of content to this page, but in the meantime, enjoy! 
</p>

## Reads
[The Tinder algorithm, explained](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18210998/tinder-algorithm-swiping-tips-dating-app-science)
* Technically a read from last week, but in honor of Valentine’s Day, this was a really humourous and interesting read. Basically, Tinder is calculating how “desirable” you are, and more desirable people are shown to one another. Long story short, I want to know who the best looking person on Tinder according to their algorithim is now.

[Cameras that understand: portrait mode and Google Lens](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/2/5/cameras-that-understand)
* An article by Ben Evans, a general partner at a16z. Really enjoyed his take on how the use of the camera evolves and how ML can adapt and leverage around those changes. Fun fact: I put this into my friend’s webapp that tests for sensationalized media, and this one went off the chain. Ben Evans is apparently _big fake news_ according to the dataset used by my friend. 

[The Cook County Sheriff’s Office Says Its Gang Database Is on Lockdown, but Questions Remain](https://www.propublica.org/article/cook-county-sheriffs-office-gang-database)
* Propublica has been documenting the disaster of the Cook County gang database for some time ([see here](https://www.propublica.org/article/politic-il-insider-chicago-gang-database)), and talks about how the decision to get rid of it hasn’t gone through entirely 

[I Cut the 'Big Five' Tech Giants From My Life. It Was Hell](https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-the-big-five-tech-giants-from-my-life-it-was-hel-1831304194)
*  This was a really great look into how the tech giants rule us. I usually always think “cut tech out of your life” is a really bad take, but the way she explicitly cut out the servers was a very interesting look into the internet ecosystem. I'm always pretty ashamed to look at my iPhone's screentime, and this article made me feel no less shame for the amount of time I spent on my devices. 

[Why Girls Beat Boys at School and Lose to Them at the Office](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/opinion/sunday/girls-school-confidence.html)
* Good and relevant opinion piece that I’ve seen a lot this week. I really related to a few parts (ie. "Too often, girls are anxious even about being anxious, so they turn to excessive studying for comfort.”), but the article missed certain points. Sure, girls seem to work “harder not smarter,” but is that really are there is to the lack of women in leadership positions across corporate America? While they nailed the different working dynamics that I see inevitably leading to burnout, I think it has no relevance to career mobility. 

## Beats 
Golden Wings (Chamber Arrangement) - Gabriel Garzon-Montano 
* It seems like everyone has been on Gabriel Garzon-Montano but me! I just discovered him, and his mixing and production, especially on this track, are phenomenal. 

No Ordinary Life - Matt Corby
* Thank you Spotify Discover Weekly, I definitely put this song on repeat, and enjoyed the piano flourishes that are trickled throghout the song. 

Poetic Justice - Kendrick Lamar 
* A TIMELESS classic, nuff said. 

Bloodline - Ariana Grande 
* Ariana Grande’s newest album was definitely just alright to me. This song, trumpets and all, makes for a great mindless track to bop to. 

Ajib Dastan Hai Yeh - Lata Mangeshkar 
* A certain friend got me back to listening to Hindi music this week, specifically to oldies like this. I never realized how nostalgic and relaxing some of this music can be. 

Crushed Out - Beach Fossils 
* Finished off my week listening to an old Beach Fossils album. Great, soothing rock for reading or writing. 

## Eats 
I started my adventures in baking this week! I made cheesecake brownies for Valentine’s Day, and I realized that boxed brownies are honestly so much more worth than making them from scratch. 

Tips:
* You can normally substitute 3/4 cup of oil for a stick of butter, but it makes for a grainier batter if you’re doing so when melting butter and sugar together. The sugar does not melt as nice. 
* Brownie batter, if made with butter from scratch, will be VERY thick! I was pretty confused by this, and added so I added a little bit of water to the batter. 
* The cheesecake topping couldn’t even be tasted, so I would not recommend it. 
* If you are making a cheesecake topping, be sure your eggs and cream cheese are room temperature. Even if ingredients are cold, you run the risk of scrambling your eggs.

I also made calzones this week! I didn’t buy mozzarella, so they lacked the gooeyness that is usually craved for in a calzone. Regardless, a pretty good attempt. Next time, we won’t skimp on the cheese and we’ll try to fold them a little prettier.

That is it for my first blogging week. Tune in next week!
