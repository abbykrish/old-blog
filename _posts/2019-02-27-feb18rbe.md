<p class="message">
Week 2 of “Reads, Beats, and Eats!” has arrived! I know I’m late, but better late than never, am I right?
</p>

## Reads
 [Why People Still Don’t Buy Groceries Online](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/online-grocery-shopping-has-been-slow-catch/581911/) 
* Last week, I was grocery shopping with a friend, when he had told me that I seem “in my element” while I trotted along the aisles of vegetables, pasta, and more. I’ve always loved grocery shopping; it is a simple pleasure that always makes me so excited. 
* I thought this was a really interesting read into why people don’t grocery shop online. I doubted that other people took as much enjoyment in it as I do, and it turns out its a lot more expensive to deliever groceries than one may have thought. 

[Crying in H Mart](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/crying-in-h-mart) 
* I read this  [Bon Appetit article](http://www.bonappetit.com/story/japanese-breakfast?utm_brand=ba&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=Social_Twitter_Healthyish) , an interview with Michelle Zauner, or Japanese Breakfast, the soft indie rocker, which reminded me of this lovely column she wrote last year about feeling family through food. 

[Pinterest Blocks Vaccination Searches in Move to Control the Conversation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-front-in-tech-firms-war-on-misinformation-bad-medical-advice-11550658601) 
* Tech companies are constantly giving us reasons as to why they can’t control disinformation well enough. This week, Pinterest set an interesting example when they simply just shut down anti-vaccination content on their platform. Steps in the right direction possibly for tech companies targeting the “fake news epidemic” 

[The challenge of America’s First Online Census](https://www.wired.com/story/us-census-2020-goes-digital/) 
* The 2020 Census is for the most part, going digital. A great read into the challenges and benefits of this monumental shift.

## Beats
Hello - Parekh & Singh / Khoj (Passing By) - When Chai Meets Toast 
* I started listening to a Spotify playlist called, “Indie India,” this week, which led me to these special tunes. I’ve always  wondered why there isn’t more of a music industry in India that operates independent of Bollywood, and it was interesting to find these two groups, (Parekh & Singh and When Chai Meets Toast) doing fun things in the indie scene across the globe. 

The Woman That Loves You - Japanese Breakfast 
* Japanese Breakfast makes a 2nd appearance this week! She has got such a unique sound, one that I know isn’t a lot of people’s style. However, this song and its melody always makes me feel /full/

HONEY - Brockhampton
* I forgot how much I loved, iridescence, Brockhampton’s newest album. I jammed out to that album several times over the last week 

All You’re Waiting For - feat. Nancy Whang - Cllassix
* A song found in the “Marketplace Music RSS” playlist on Spotify. I’m really so glad that exists. 
* I recently saw a tweet from someone who worked at NPR talking about how it was part of his job to pick music for the background of APM shows, and I think that would be quite a splendid job. 


## Eats
Snickerdoodle Cookies 
* Part 2 in my adventures in baking reminded me as to why I have stayed away from baking in the past.
* These  cookies looked promising on the sheet pan, but they didn’t spread out or bake correctly in the oven. They simply rose, and had an odd, crumbly texture out of the oven. Fortunately, after a day, they tasted more like shortbread. 
* I predict that I creamed the butter and sugar for way too long, because I sat there with the mixer for over 10 minutes trying to get the sugar to dissolve in the butter. Possibly next time, I’ll see that the butter is warmer, and I beat it for less. Also, the pan may have not been a proper cookie sheet, providing not enough heat on the bottom for it to spread out. 
* For reference, I used a pretty simple [sugar cookie recipe](https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/best-soft-and-chewy-sugar-cookies/), and dipped the dough in cinnamon sugar before baking.

Garlic Knots and Tomato Paste based pasta sauce 
* I also had leftover pizza dough, so I made garlic knots! They came out mostly well, a bit of the hardness in the texture came because the pizza dough had been sitting in my fridge and was definitely over-proved. 
* I also happened to not have crushed tomatoes in the apartment, so I made pasta sauce with tomato paste. I used a base of garlic, olive oil, seasoning, and fresh tomato, then finished it off with pasta water. I would recommend using a base of not /just/ pasta water, as it becomes difficult to regulate salt.
